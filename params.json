Router.js is your application entry point.  If you want to use more than one router you can create more instances of Router in main.js.\r\n* add your google analytics account number to src/main/webapp/js/Constants.js\r\n* `mvn install -P optimize` to minify and concatenate css\r\n* edit amazonAccessKey and amazon amazonKeySecret to match your amazon web service credentials in pom.xml\r\n* `mvn spab:versioned-deploy` to gzip compress your app, deploy your app to the cloudfront content delivery network, set gzip and caching http headers on your deployed css and javascript in your s3 origin, and invalidate your root object so your application becomes live as soon as all cloudfront edge servers have received your updated app\r\n* `mvn spab:rollback <version_number>` to roll your app back to a specific version number on the cloudfront content delivery network\r\n\r\nMore Detailed Documentation\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n* [How do I map a domain name to my app once it's deployed to cloudfront?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-I-map-a-domain-name-to-my-app-once-it's-deployed-to-cloudfront%3F)\r\n* [How do I access my application server from my ui code?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-I-access-my-application-server-from-my-ui-code%3F)\r\n* [How do I setup continuous integration?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-I-setup-continuous-integration%3F)\r\n* [How do I update the javascript library dependencies to their latest versions?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-I-update-the-javascript-library-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions%3F)\r\n* [How do install java and maven in under 10 minutes if I don't already have them installed?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-install-java-and-maven%3F)\r\n* [Do I have to deploy my application to cloudfront?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/Do-I-have-to-deploy-my-application-to-cloudfront%3F)\r\n* [Do you recommend a specific IDE for javascript development?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/Do-you-recommend-a-specific-IDE-for-javascript-development%3F)\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* [TODO MVC App In Single Page App Boilerplate](https://github.com/davidjnelson/todo-mvc-in-single-page-app-boilerplate)\r\n\r\nHave A Question, Found A Bug, Idea For A New Feature, Or Want To Follow Me On Twitter?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Questions: [Post it to the Single Page App Boilerplate google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/single-page-app-boilerplate)\r\n* Found A Bug: [Create A New Issue](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/issues/new)\r\n* Idea For A New Feature: [Create A New Issue](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/issues/new)\r\n* Follow Me On Twitter: [@david_j_nelson](https://twitter.com/david_j_nelson)\r\n"}
