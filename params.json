Wrap your jasmine specs in requirejs define calls.  See HelloWorldViewTest.js for an example.\r\n* add your app code to `src/main/webapp/js`.`{  }`Router.js is your application entry point.  If you want to use more than one router you can create more instances of Router in main.js.\r\n* add your google analytics account number to `src/main/webapp/js/Constants.js`\r\n* `mvn install -P optimize` to minify and concatenate css.  Your deployable site will be output to `target/minified-output`.  To use the optimized version, load index.html.  To use the debug version, load index_unminified.html.\r\n\r\nFuture Project Goals\r\n--------------------\r\n* Run your integration tests during continuous integration only for faster development\r\n* jshint integration\r\n* deployment to the cloudfront cdn using an s3 or elastic beanstalk origin while setting gzip and caching http headers\r\n* no modifications made javascript libraries by using requirejs shims.  currently libraries are wrapped with an AMD module\r\n* One command to update your javascript libraries to their latest versions\r\n* Integrate with yeoman for scaffolding for major js libraries other than Backbone\r\n* One command to rollback your application to a different version\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Detailed Documentation\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n* [How do I access my application server from my ui code?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-I-access-my-application-server-from-my-ui-code%3F)\r\n* [How do I setup continuous integration?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-I-setup-continuous-integration%3F)\r\n* [How do I update the javascript library dependencies to their latest versions?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-I-update-the-javascript-library-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions%3F)\r\n* [How do install java and maven in under 10 minutes if I don't already have them installed?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/How-do-install-java-and-maven%3F)\r\n* [Do you recommend a specific IDE for javascript development?](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/wiki/Do-you-recommend-a-specific-IDE-for-javascript-development%3F)\r\n\r\nHave A Question, Found A Bug, Idea For A New Feature, Or Want To Follow Me On Twitter?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Found A Bug: [Create A New Issue](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/issues/new)\r\n* Idea For A New Feature: [Create A New Issue](https://github.com/davidjnelson/single-page-app-boilerplate/issues/new)\r\n* Follow Me On Twitter: [@david_j_nelson](https://twitter.com/david_j_nelson)\r\n","google":"UA-6242674-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
